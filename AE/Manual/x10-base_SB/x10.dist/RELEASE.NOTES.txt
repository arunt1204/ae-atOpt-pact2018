X10 Release 2.6.0

HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS RELEASE

The X10 language now includes an overloading mechanism for redefining
or extending the behavior of control structures.  For more details,
refer to the language manual section on user-defined control
structures or the X10'16 paper "Control Structure Overloading in X10."

The X10 language now supports trailing closures. A trailing closure is
a closure block that is written and after the parentheses of a
function call. This closure block is passed as a closure without
argument to the function. 

To resolve parsing ambiguities, the property keyword is now mandatory
to introduce property methods.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The size and index of arrays must be less than 2^31 with Managed X10.
An attempt to allocate a longer array causes IllegalArgumentException. 

The following features described in the 2.5 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On Power/Linux and BG/Q, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better
    or xlC 11.1 or better.
